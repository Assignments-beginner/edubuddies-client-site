        This website is specifically designed for young and ambitions people
        looking to launch their careers in turbulent 2022. Based on our
        experience, this website is also popular among the parents of fresh
        graduates who are looking for ways to support their children at this
        pivotal point of their life, known as a career choice.

        We like to repeat there is no magic in internship and job search
        process. It is the magic outcome you get after you do the right steps.
        Treat this website as an accelerator of career launch. Because the
        object is very concrete and not abstract - getting clarity, acting
        strategically, and landing a dream internship or job.
